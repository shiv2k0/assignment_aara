    content: `Tesla will announce its second-quarter earnings Wednesday after the bell. Investors will be listening out for more details on the much-delayed Cybertruck, as well as how Tesla’s many price cuts have affected automotive gross margins. 

    Wall Street estimates predict Tesla will bring in around $24.9 billion in revenue for the quarter, which is nearly 50% higher than year-ago sales of $16.9 billion. 
    
    Tesla’s stock has shot up 168.62% since the start of the year. It closed at $290.38 Monday afternoon, riding the high of the news that the first Cybertruck was finally built over the weekend. `,

      "Thousands of authors sign letter urging AI makers to stop stealing books",

    content: `If you ask GPT-4 to do a passage in the style of Carmen Machado or Margaret Atwood or Alexander Chee, it will do a fair job at it, and for good reason: it likely ingested all their works in the training process, and now uses their ingenuity for its own. But these authors, and thousands more, are not happy with this fact.

    In an open letter signed by more more than 8,500 authors of fiction, non-fiction, and poetry, the tech companies behind large language models like ChatGPT, Bard, LLaMa and more are taken to task for using their writing without permission or compensation.
    
    “These technologies mimic and regurgitate our language, stories, style, and ideas. Millions of copyrighted books, articles, essays, and poetry provide the ‘food’ for AI systems, endless meals for which there has been no bill,” the letter reads.`,

      "Austin Russell became the youngest self-made billionaire in 2021; now he owns Forbes",

    content: `The 28-year-old founder and CEO of Luminar, which develops vision-based lidar and machine perception technologies primarily for self-driving cars, told The Wall Street Journal earlier today that he is buying an 82% stake in Forbes Global Media Holdings in a deal that values the company at nearly $800 million.

    According to the WSJ, Russell’s stake includes the remaining portion of the company owned by its namesake family, which sold 95% of the company to the Hong Kong-based investor group Integrated Whale Media back in 2014. Forbes was essentially on sale from the moment it called off its merger with a special-purpose acquisition company in June of last year, after the market soured and investors lost their appetite for SPACs.
    
    
    Luminar itself had better timing; it went public via a SPAC merger in 2021 when retail investors were still clamoring for shares in mobility tech companies. Still, by the time Forbes was calling off its own SPAC plans, nearly every mobility SPAC was trading below its offering price, and Luminar has not been immune to the broader downturn. Valued at $3.4 billion when it hit Wall Street, its market cap is now roughly $2 billion. Just three days ago it reported slightly wider than expected losses.`,

    It is always hard to know how a startup category will fare in a downturn. But if you had asked me a few months ago, I would have expected cybersecurity to be relatively recession-proof, just like data observability. What I didn’t have in my cards yet, though, was generative AI and animal agriculture. — Anna`,
